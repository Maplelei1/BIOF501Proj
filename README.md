Standard Operating Procedure Template

As part of your project, you must:
◦ Describe the dataset, providing full accession details, number of individuals in the cohort,
type of data (DNA, RNA, methylation, etc) and other relevant metadata
◦ Some tools may accept several datasets or types (be specific and document flexibility)
◦ Clearly define your control and test groups
◦ Clearly state your hypothesis, aims and objectives
◦ Clearly describe your environment (python version, NextFlow version, package versions, etc)
Workflow creation


The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must provide details on:
◦ Information about the pipeline and what it aims to do
◦ Expected results
◦ Usage instructions so that another person can replicate your results
◦ The setup of the environment as well as package versions so that it can be replicated
easily
◦ Information about the data used in the analysis (source, accession date, number of
samples, disease status, etc.)
◦ Any accessory programs that will be called (including version numbers)

Background and Rationale
• include the what’s and why’s – also your aims
• include any package dependencies that are required (bullet points are ok for this)
• You can include your DAG here

Usage
Make sure you format everything so that step by step usage details are included. If we can’t run your
pipeline then we can’t give you marks.
• Installation (if necessary) including any datasets that are to be used if they are not provided
(i.e. how to download them using wget or curl – exact paths need to be specified and the data
must be accessible)
• Exact step by step usage with descriptive comments on what action is being performed in each
step

Input
Describe the format of the input data, explaining all fields.

Output
Describe the format of the output including files and visualizations. Treat this section like the results of
a paper. You can look at readthedocs pages of popular bioinformatics tools to get inspired for this.
